## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r} 
library(dplyr)
data <- read.csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv",
     na.strings = "",header=T)

USA <- data$iso_code == "USA"
US <- data.frame(data[USA, ])
US_T <- US %>% filter(!is.na(new_tests))

model <- lm(US_T$new_deaths~US_T$new_tests)
summary(model)

library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(US_T, aes_string(x = "new_tests", y = "new_deaths"))
p1 <- ggplot_add(geom_point(), p1)
fit <- lm(US_T$new_deaths~US_T$new_tests)
coefs <- coef(fit)
p2 <- p1+geom_abline(intercept = coefs[1], slope = coefs[2], color = "orange")
print(p2)
```

### Our Finding 
While testing the COVID-19 data in the United States, our group found a positive relationship between the number of new COVID-19 tests in August 2021 and the number of new deaths that happened in the country in the same month and year. This analysis produced a “significant” p-value (p = 2.2e-16), which indicates that COVID-19 testing is directly related to the increase in deaths.
Our group found a nonsensical positive relationship between the number of new COVID-19 tests in August 2021 and the number of new deaths due to COVID-19. The low number of analyzed data can explain this result. The analysis could have reached a different outcome if we also explored other time periods, not only August 2021. Moreover, this is a case of a reversed causal relationship. The number of COVID-19 tests and COVID-19 related deaths is directly proportional as the number of tests increases as more people get infected and die from COVID-19. The increase in deaths from COVID-19 has increased public health efforts to prevent deaths and hospital visits, thereby warranting increased funding and access to testing sites to increase tests. However, there is still disproportionate access to testing in some communities, so as the national testing expands, deaths are still increasing in some areas due to limited contact tracing and testing. Thus, our group concluded that some practices regarding analyzing the data can lead to fallacious correlations and conclusions.
